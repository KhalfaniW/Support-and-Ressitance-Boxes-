######This is an indicator for the forex market, an indicator is a tool that helps traders and analyzers get a estimation as too whether the market will go up or down. A few months ago I wanted to make my own strategy for trading the forex market so I created an indicator that  creates a signal once a asset makes a specific pattern.

This indicator is based the MetaTrader platform:  Metatrader is an application that displays currency market data, it also has its own programming language MQL4. MQL4 is comparable to C++.
